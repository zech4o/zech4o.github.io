intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I'm a MPhil student in the [Institute of Cyberspace Research (ICSR)](https://icsr.zju.edu.cn/icsren/main.htm) at Zhejiang University. I'm working with Prof. [Wenbo Shen](https://wenboshen.org/). My research interests include operating system design and security, with a focus on hardware-software collaboration for security and performance.
    Recently, I'm digging in Apple-silicon-based system (iOS/macOS).


    Now I'm looking for a PhD position (or a job), and I expected to graduate in Fall 2023. Feel free to reach out to me.


    Interests: Music (Record collecting). Food (Chaoshan/Hunan/... cuisine). Travel (Music festival, Nature).
