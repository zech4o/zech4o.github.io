   Zechao Cai is a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, ETH Zurich, supervised by Prof. Adrian Perrig. He is also working closely with Prof. Huayi Duan. His research interests lie in new and messy computer systems, where cool ideas coexist, usually working well but far from elegant.
   
    
    Before transferring to ETH due to personal and family reasons, he was a PhD student at Columbia University, working with Prof. Gail Kaiser and Prof. Jason Nieh. He remains grateful for the support and guidance he received from his professors and friends at Columbia. His academic journey began at Zhejiang University, where he completed his master’s degree under the supervision of Prof. Wenbo Shen.
