   Zechao Cai is a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, ETH Zurich.

    He is interested in the science and art of designing, developing, and interconnecting software and hardware components to build systems that serve diverse goals. His research interests mainly lie in Computer Systems topics-OS, Networking, PL, ComputerArch, MLsys, blablabla. Recently he's messing with caching systems and exploring other topics.

    He also has a profound passion for music/philosophy/art/food. His aspiration is to become a composer/writer/walker/eater/sleeper and run away from computer science, but so far he fails on this, wish one day he could.

    He is open to collaboration/talking. Reach out to him if you think he can help you. For other unuseful info besides above (e.g., publications), see ⬇️.
